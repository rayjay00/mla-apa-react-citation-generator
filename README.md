##About This Project

This is a citation generator that toggles between MLA and APA book citations. I used styled components and Create React App to get started. 

If you toggle to APA, a new form field will show up for a state. If you don't enter one (or toggle from MLA  to APA), it will account for it by ommitting the space. If you start with APA, the form field for state is required.

Future ideas for this project:
* Add an option to copy the citation from the modal and the list
* Use local storage to display previous citations
* More citation options
